Passwords are the keys to your digital life. Every time you log in to your email, social media, or online banking, you’re using a password to prove it’s really you. Unfortunately, weak or reused passwords are one of the easiest ways for attackers to break into accounts.

In this course, you’ll learn why strong passwords matter, how to create them without frustration, and how to manage them safely so you don’t have to rely on memory alone.

## 🗂️ Course Outline

### Lesson 1: Why Strong Passwords Matter

- **Learning objectives:**

  - Understand the risks of weak or reused passwords
  - Learn how attackers try to break into accounts

- **Main content:**
  - Hackers often use **stolen password lists** from old breaches to try logging into other accounts (this is called credential stuffing).
  - Short or simple passwords like “123456” or “password” can be guessed in seconds.
  - Reusing the same password across accounts means if one account is hacked, the others are at risk too.
  - A strong password forces attackers to work much harder, making brute-force or guessing attacks unrealistic.

### Lesson 2: How to Create Strong Passwords

- **Learning objectives:**

  - Learn techniques for creating secure, unique passwords
  - Understand the value of passphrases

- **Main content:**
  - Aim for at least **12 characters** — the longer, the stronger.
  - Use a mix of **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols**.
  - Avoid personal information such as names, birthdays, or pets.
  - Use **passphrases** — strings of random words that are easier to remember but still strong.
    - Example: `BlueRain!CoffeeHorse2025`
  - Think of creative combinations instead of predictable ones like “Summer2025!”

### Lesson 3: Managing Your Passwords

- **Learning objectives:**

  - Explore methods to safely store and organize passwords
  - Understand the importance of password managers

- **Main content:**
  - **Never reuse** the same password across accounts.
  - Use a **password manager** — a secure app that stores, generates, and autofills strong passwords for you.
  - Turn on **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** wherever possible for extra protection.
  - Change passwords immediately if you suspect an account has been hacked.
  - Regularly check if your email or passwords have appeared in data breaches using trusted tools (e.g., “Have I Been Pwned”).

## 📝 Exercises / Activities

- Create a new passphrase using at least four random words and one special character.
- Install a password manager and try generating a strong password for one of your accounts.
