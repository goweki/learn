### Common Signs of Phishing

- **Unexpected or urgent requests:** Messages that pressure you to act now (e.g., “Your account will be closed!”).  
- **Generic greetings:** “Dear customer” instead of your name.  
- **Suspicious sender address:** The display name may look right but the email address is slightly off (e.g., support@yourbank-security.com).  
- **Poor spelling and grammar:** Many phishing messages contain mistakes or awkward phrasing.  
- **Strange links or attachments:** Links that don’t match the visible text, or unexpected files attached.  
- **Requests for sensitive info:** Legitimate organisations rarely ask for passwords, PINs, or full ID by email or text.

### Examples You Might See

- An email that looks like your bank asking you to “verify your account” via a link.  
- A text message claiming you have a missed delivery and asking you to click a tracking link.  
- A social media DM from an account impersonating a friend with a suspicious shortened link.  
- A fake login page that mirrors a real service to capture your credentials.

### How to Verify Messages and Links

- **Don’t click links right away.** Hover over the link to see the real URL (on mobile, press and hold).  
- **Check the sender address** carefully — small differences matter.  
- **Open the website directly** by typing the company’s known web address into your browser instead of using the link.  
- **Look for HTTPS and the padlock** on pages that ask for login info (but remember HTTPS alone doesn’t guarantee safety).  
- **Use official apps** (banking, delivery) rather than links in messages when possible.  
- **Ask the sender directly** (via a known contact method) if you’re unsure — not by replying to the suspicious message.

### What to Do If You Think It’s Phishing

- Do not click links or download attachments.  
- Report the message to your IT team or email provider (many services have “report phishing” options).  
- If you entered credentials on a suspicious page, change your password immediately and enable MFA.  
- If you provided financial info, contact your bank right away and monitor your accounts.  
- Delete the message after reporting it.

## 📝 Summary

Phishing relies on urgency, disguise, and trust. By pausing before you click, checking sender details and links, and using direct channels to verify requests, you can avoid most phishing attempts. Reporting suspicious messages helps protect everyone.

## 🎯 Next Steps

- The next time you get an unexpected message asking for action, pause and apply the checks above.  
- Enable MFA on accounts so stolen passwords are less useful to attackers.  
- Share one phishing tip with a friend or colleague today to help them stay safe.
