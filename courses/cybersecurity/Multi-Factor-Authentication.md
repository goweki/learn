## üìò Description

This course is designed for anyone who wants to secure their digital accounts against hackers and cybercriminals. With just a password, your accounts can be vulnerable‚Äîespecially if that password is weak, reused, or stolen in a data breach.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) strengthens your security by adding another step to the login process, such as a code sent to your phone or a fingerprint scan. Even if an attacker has your password, they‚Äôll still need this second factor to get in.

By the end of this course, you‚Äôll know what MFA is, why it matters, and how to set it up on your most important accounts.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Ability to log into common accounts like email or social media
- Basic understanding of passwords and login processes
- No technical background required

## üóÇÔ∏è Course Outline

### Lesson 1: What is MFA?

- **Learning Objectives**:

  - Understand the concept of MFA
  - Explain how MFA protects your accounts

- **Main Content**:  
  Think of MFA as putting a second lock on your digital door. Instead of relying on just one password, MFA combines different types of proof:

  - **Something you know**: your password
  - **Something you have**: a code sent to your phone, an authenticator app, or a hardware key
  - **Something you are**: fingerprint, face scan, or voice recognition

  This combination makes it far more difficult for attackers to break in.

### Lesson 2: Examples of MFA in Action

- **Learning Objectives**:

  - Identify where MFA is commonly used
  - Recognize the different forms MFA can take

- **Main Content**:  
  You may already be using MFA without realizing it. Examples include:

  - Logging into your email with a password **plus** a text message code
  - Signing in to social media with a password **plus** a fingerprint scan
  - Using an authenticator app that generates a one-time code every 30 seconds

  Each of these adds a valuable barrier against hackers.

### Lesson 3: How to Enable MFA

- **Learning Objectives**:

  - Know where to find MFA options in your accounts
  - Take the first steps to activate MFA

- **Main Content**:  
  Most major services now offer MFA in their **security settings**.
  - Go to your account‚Äôs security or login settings
  - Look for options called **‚ÄúTwo-Factor Authentication (2FA)‚Äù** or **‚ÄúMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA)‚Äù**
  - Choose your preferred method: SMS codes, an authenticator app, or biometrics if available
  - Test it to ensure it works smoothly before relying on it

## üìù Exercises / Activities

- Enable MFA on one of your important accounts today (e.g., email, banking, or social media)
- Try out both SMS-based codes and an authenticator app to see the difference
- Make a checklist of all the accounts you use and note which ones already have MFA enabled
