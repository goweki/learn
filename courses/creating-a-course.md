# How to Create a Course (A Guide)

This guide explains how to create a new course in Markdown format for this documentation site.  
It is tailored for professionals and subject matter experts who want to make courses visually clear, structured, and easy to navigate.

---

## 1. Download the Course Template

Every new course should start from the template to ensure consistency.

ðŸ‘‰ <a href="/files/course-template.md" download="course-template.md">Download Course Template</a>

The template contains:

- Standard headings
- Sections for description, prerequisites, lessons, and resources
- Example formatting (lists, links, and exercises)

---

## 2. Organize Your Files

1. Save the downloaded template into the project folder:
2. Rename the file to match your course name. Use lowercase letters and dashes for spaces:

   ```
   eg. how-to-create-a-course.md

    ðŸ’¡ Tip: A clear filename makes it easier to reference the course later.
   ```

---

## 3. Fill Out the Template with Content

When writing your course, focus on **clarity, structure, and design consistency**.

### 3.1 Course Title & Description

- Title should be **short and descriptive**.  
  Example: `Responsive Web Design`
- Description should be **1â€“3 sentences** explaining what the learner will achieve.  
  Example:
  > Learn the foundations of responsive design, including fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries.

### 3.2 Prerequisites

- List skills or tools required before taking the course.
- Keep it in bullet points for easy scanning.
- Example:
- Basic knowledge of HTML & CSS
- Familiarity with browser developer tools

### 3.3 Content Sections (Lessons/Modules)

Break the course into lessons or modules. Use headings (`##` or `###`) to make them scannable.

    Example:

    ```markdown
    ## Lesson 1: Fluid Layouts

    - Explain why fixed layouts break
    - Show examples of fluid grids
    - Provide short CSS code snippets
    ```

### 3.4 Exercises / Activities

Always include at least one practical task per lesson.

Make activities action-oriented: `Design a wireframe`, `Create a grid system`, `Test on 3 devices`.

### 3.5 Resources

Provide curated links to design systems, UI kits, articles, and tools.

Example:

```Google Material Design
Smashing Magazine on Responsive Design
```

## 4. Design & Formatting Guidelines

- Pay attention to how your Markdown looks when rendered.

- Use hierarchy properly:

  ```
  # for course title (only once)

  ## for major sections

  ### for subsections
  ```

- Use lists instead of long paragraphs for better readability.

- Add visuals when helpful:

- Share any images and screenshots linked in a course. Place images in `/static/img/courses/` and reference them like:

`![Wireframe Example](/img/template/lisa_landing_page.png)`

Use callouts/admonitions for emphasis:

:::tip
Always test your layout on both desktop and mobile!

5. Share the Course for Upload

Once your course is ready:

Review for:

Consistency with other courses

Clear structure and headings

Proper spelling and grammar

Accessibility (e.g., alt text for images)

Share the .md file with the site admin for publishing.

Deliver professional, accessible learning content

âš¡ This version is **longer, more structured, and designer-focused** (hierarchy, formatting, visuals, readability).

Do you want me to also **export this improved version as a Word file** like we did with the last one?
