# ✏️ Intro to UI/UX Design

Welcome to **Intro to UI/UX**, a self-paced course designed to help you master the fundamentals of creating user-friendly, visually engaging digital products.

This course blends **theory, practice, and reflection** so you not only learn _what_ UI/UX is, but also _how_ to apply it in real projects.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Explain the difference between **UI** (User Interface) and **UX** (User Experience).
- Identify the principles of **good design** and **usability**.
- Use simple design tools to create wireframes and prototypes.
- Critically evaluate a digital product for UI/UX strengths and weaknesses.

---

## 📚 Module 1: What is UI/UX?

- **UI (User Interface):** The look and feel — colors, typography, buttons, and layouts.
- **UX (User Experience):** The journey — how intuitive, useful, and satisfying the product feels.

👉 **Activity:** Pick your favorite app and ask:

- How easy is it to navigate?
- Do you enjoy the look and feel?
- What frustrates you?

Take 2–3 notes — we’ll come back to this later.

## 🧩 Module 2: Core Principles of Design

The **Five Pillars of UI/UX**:

1. **Clarity** – Content is easy to read and understand.
2. **Consistency** – Design elements behave predictably.
3. **Feedback** – The system responds to user actions.
4. **Efficiency** – Tasks take minimal effort to complete.
5. **Delight** – A touch of personality makes the experience enjoyable.

👉 **Exercise:** Look at a website of your choice. Which of the 5 pillars does it do well? Which is weakest?

## ✏️ Module 3: Wireframing Basics

Wireframing is **sketching the structure** of a digital product without worrying about colors or styling.

- Start with pen and paper or a free tool (Figma, Balsamiq, Excalidraw).
- Focus on **layouts and flows** rather than polished design.

👉 **Mini Project:** Wireframe a simple **login screen** with:

- A logo
- Username + Password fields
- Login button
- “Forgot password?” link

---

## 🧪 Module 4: Prototyping & Testing

A prototype is an **interactive model** of your design. It helps you test before you build.

- Use tools like **Figma** or **InVision**.
- Share your prototype with 2–3 people and ask them to complete a task.

👉 **Task:** Create a clickable prototype of your login screen and ask someone:  
“Can you log in?”

- Observe where they hesitate.
- Note down feedback.

---

## 🌟 Final Project: Redesign an Everyday Experience

Choose a simple, everyday interaction (e.g., ordering food online, signing up for a newsletter, booking a ticket).

1. **Current State:** Capture screenshots and note pain points.
2. **Wireframe:** Sketch your improved flow.
3. **Prototype:** Build a simple clickable demo.
4. **Reflect:** What did you improve? What still needs work?
