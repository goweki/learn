**Clone the repository (if you haven't already)**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goweki/full.stacked.git

    ```

## RUBY code directory

1. Check if your development environment has ruby installed

   ```bash
   ruby -v
   ```

   It should print the ruby version you are running e.g. `ruby 3.2.2 (2023-03-30 revision e51014f9c0) [arm64-darwin21]`

   If the above command failed, then you should first install ruby. Use the following [Guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

2. Navigate into the ruby directory:

   ```bash
   cd ./full.stacked/episode01/ruby
   ```

3. Install the [TZinfo gem](https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo):

   ```bash
   gem install tzinfo
   ```

4. Run code:
   ```bash
   ruby main.rb
   ```

## TS code directory

1.  **Navigate into the ts directory**:

    ```bash
    cd ./full.stacked/episode01/ts
    ```

2.  **Compile transcript code**:

    ```bash
    npm install -g typescript
    tsc main.ts
    ```

3.  **Run the compiled js file**

    ```bash
    node main.js
    ```
