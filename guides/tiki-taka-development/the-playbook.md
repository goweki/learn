# Tiki-Taka Playbook ⚽️✨

_A high-skill, async-first, low-overhead delivery style inspired by tiki-taka football._

## 1) What “Tiki-Taka” Means

Tiki-Taka Development is how we ship high-quality product increments through:

- **Short passes** (small tasks + small PRs)
- **Constant movement** (daily progress, minimal waiting)
- **On-need collaboration** (activate talent briefly, then release)
- **Relay handoffs** (clean continuity, no training overhead)
- **Assumption-light iteration** (validate early, adapt fast)

**Goal:** Ship functional + polished outcomes with maximum efficiency and minimum waste.

---

## 2) Core Principles (The Rules of Play)

1. **Short passes > long throws**
2. **Async by default** (work must move without meetings)
3. **Activate talent only when needed**
4. **Relay handoffs, not hard handoffs**
5. **Small PRs, fast reviews, frequent shipping**
6. **Validate assumptions early**
7. **Quality is part of speed**
8. **Keep ownership clear** (one driver at a time)

---

## 3) Talent Pool Model ⭐️

We operate as a pool of **mid-to-senior multitalented players**:

- Each person owns their main lane (design/dev/PM/QA/ops)
- Each person can cover adjacent lanes when needed
- Collaboration is **tactical + timeboxed**
- After contribution, talent is **released back to their star projects**

**Tiki-Taka only works with high-skill players:**

- Strong fundamentals (“first touch”)
- Good intuition (“dribble”)
- Async working discipline

---

## 4) Collaboration Style (On-Need Activation)

When a project needs support, we “pass” the work briefly:

**Examples**

- Need UX clarity? Pull design for **30–90 mins** → get flows → release.
- Need architecture decision? Pull senior dev for **15 mins** → decide → release.
- Need scope alignment? Pull PM for **20 mins** → lock goal → release.

No long staffing. No permanent dependency chains.

## 5) Relay Handoff Standard 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️ (No Training Required)

Handoffs must be lightweight and instantly actionable.

### Relay Handoff Template

**Current State**

- What exists now:
- Links (PR / issue / Figma / docs):

**Next Pass**

- What to do next (1–3 bullets):
- Expected output:

**Definition of Done**

- Acceptance criteria:

**Risks / Gotchas**

- Known pitfalls:
- What not to break:

**Owner + Timebox**

- Driver:
- Timebox (e.g. 2–6 hrs / 1 day / 2 days):

---

## 6) Sprint / Iteration Rhythm (Minimal Ceremony)

We use Agile principles, but keep it light.

### Recommended cadence

- **1–2 week sprint**
- **Daily async update**
- **Demo at end**
- **Retro: 1 improvement only**

### Daily Async Update (Copy/Paste)

**Yesterday**

- …

**Today**

- …

**Blocked**

- …

**Next Pass Needed**

- (Who/what I need, timeboxed)

---

## 7) Work Slicing (Keep It Playable)

Work must be cut into **demo-able increments**.

✅ Good slices:

- “Create login page + validate inputs + wire API”
- “Add delivery status timeline UI + dummy data”
- “Add webhook handler + store events + basic retry”

❌ Bad slices:

- “Build authentication system”
- “Finish backend”
- “Do UI”

Rule: if it can’t be demo’d, it’s too big.

---

## 8) PR Standards (Fast + Clean)

**PR size target:** small enough to review in **5–15 mins**.

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Clear title + description
- [ ] Linked issue / goal
- [ ] Screenshots for UI changes
- [ ] No unnecessary refactors bundled in
- [ ] Tests updated (where critical)
- [ ] Logs/telemetry considered (where needed)

### PR Description Template

**What**

- …

**Why**

- …

**How to test**

- …

**Notes / risks**

## 9) Decision Rules (Keep Momentum)

- Prefer **small decisions fast** over perfect decisions late
- Write decisions down (avoid “lost in chat”)
- If stuck >30 mins → ask for a **quick pass** (short unblock)

---

## 10) Tiki-Taka Scoreboard 🏆

We measure success by:

- Lead time to ship
- Review turnaround speed
- Quality + stability
- Clarity of ownership
- Minimal meeting load
- User feedback loop speed

**We win when the Product ships fast and feels premium.**
